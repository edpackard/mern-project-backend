## MERN project

I'm following the guidance on the ["Full Stack open 2021"](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) website to build a MERN app with testing.

I'm starting off with the backend tutorials here:

https://fullstackopen.com/en/part4
(about to start 4(c))

requests directory: contains API route requests using REST extension for VS code.
